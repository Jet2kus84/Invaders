
PROBLEMS DURING DEVELOPMENT

1.) Missile remains drawn once it hits a target

2.) When moving collision check from the move() method in the missile entity class to another class, 
a null exception is thrown when starting the game. classes that may be contributing to this issue: 
MissileEntity & ShipEntity.

who is throwing the exception?
--the missile entity is throwing the null exception.

why is the null exception being thrown?
--Once the missile is created, in the missile entity default constructor the missile collision object
accesses the collision list, but the default constructor is never called, so the collision missile field
is never initialized.

3.) Getting a concurrentModification exception when missile hit target.

who is throwing the exception?
The acceptAll() method in the entity manager class is throwing the exception.

why is the concurentModification exception being thrown?
The exception is being thrown because there are too many non-permissible modifications occuring within 
the list to the missile entity.

4.) When missile collides with squid entity, more than one squid is removed.

possible classes involved: Squid entity & Missile Entity

additional info: Missile Entity has a default constructor that is used in order to make 
draw & fire not return null(one in the chamber so to speak)

SOLUTIONS(each solution is associated with a problem by number)

1.) Allow the ShipEntity to control missile fire. When the ship fires a missile it will initialize 
the static "loaded" field to true. the missile entity will use this static field to determine when 
to move/draw the missile on screen. 

2.) removed the default constructor from the missile entity class. The default constructor attempts to
access a collision missile from the collision manager list. The default constructor is never called to 
the collision missile field is never initialized and access to the getEntity() method, that is located in
the missile entity class, causes a null exception to be thrown.

3.) I changed the current entity manager list field into an array, along with the visitor argument which
is also a linked list. I iterated through both arrays and accepted each visitor.

4. I removed the missile entity's default constructor, the default constructor which was called in 
the Content class was causing residual effects. all missile resources are loaded and used in the
missile entity class.
